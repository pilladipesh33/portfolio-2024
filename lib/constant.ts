Throughout this journey, I've been curious about understanding to build more intuitive things- which leaves me in developer hub where everyday someone creates and architect a new product and still there is so much still to explore.",
  CONTENT_3:
    "During my final year, I decided to shift my career toward developing in computing spaces because of a desire to work at large and faster scales. While computing field slowly evolves, still at the heart of this discipline are what make product valuable - It improves people's lives through emotion, usability and functionality. Instead of joining connection in a circuit board, I want people to use my create websites or app so that I can connect with them. Engineering has also given me a spactial 'taste' of connecting two dots, to make line which now allow me to bring systematic interface that feel more humane.",
